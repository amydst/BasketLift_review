# BasketLift review

This report analyzes data collected from various reports generated by the back-end software of our POS system, Catapult, by ECRS.

The findings were presented to the Board of Directors, many of whom were not involved in the development or approval of the promotion last year. As such, additional context may be needed.

The purpose of this analysis is to inform the decision on whether to maintain or discontinue the promotion.

The analysis demonstrated that the promotion successfully exceeded both expectations and set goals, showcasing a significant uplift in sales.
